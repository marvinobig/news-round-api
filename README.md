# News Round API

## Background

We will be building an API for the purpose of accessing application data programmatically. The intention here is to mimic the building of a real world backend service (such as reddit) which should provide this information to the front end architecture.

Your database will be PSQL, and you will interact with it using [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/).

## Running the test and development databases locally

To access the databes (test & development) locally, create two .env files titled (.env.test & .env.development).
